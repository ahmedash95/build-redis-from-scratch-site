The first step is to start a TCP listener so that any [Client](first-steps#preparing-the-client) can communicate with it.


```go
l, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":6379")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}
```


Then we start receiving requests.


```go
conn, err := l.Accept()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}

defer conn.Close() // close connection once finished
```


After that, we create an infinite loop to receive commands from clients and respond to them.


```go
for {
    buf := make([]byte, 1024)

    // read message from client
    _, err = conn.Read(buf)
    if err != nil {
        if err == io.EOF {
            break
        }
        fmt.Println("error reading from client: ", err.Error())
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    // ignore request and send back a PONG
    conn.Write([]byte("+OK\r\n"))
}
```


Note that in the last line, we respond with "OK" regardless of the command received from the client.

Therefore, the complete code will be as follows:


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Listening on port :6379")

	// Create a new server
	l, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":6379")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Listen for connections
	conn, err := l.Accept()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	defer conn.Close()

	for {
		buf := make([]byte, 1024)

		// read message from client
		_, err = conn.Read(buf)
		if err != nil {
			if err == io.EOF {
				break
			}
			fmt.Println("error reading from client: ", err.Error())
			os.Exit(1)
		}

		// ignore request and send back a PONG
		conn.Write([]byte("+OK\r\n"))
	}
}
```


If we try to run the server and communicate with it using redis-cli, we can see the expected response.

Note that the port number is the same as Redis.

## Conclusion

With this, we have completed the first part, where we created a server that can be communicated with by any Redis client and receive responses from it.

Currently, the response is a single "OK". However, in the upcoming parts, we will start changing this to respond to commands like set, get, hset, hget.
